This is a Python application designed to compute Boolean functions based on the number of input/output variables and the cases where the output variables are 1, 0, or X. The project was developed during a course on real-time operating systems, where we encountered several sequential problems. When the input/output variables are few, coding with switch cases is manageable. However, for a larger number of variables, I proposed creating a function that takes input states and sets outputs using a Boolean function.

The application includes a GUI where you can specify the number of inputs and outputs, set the cases for 1, 0, or X, and then obtain the corresponding Boolean function. The calculations are performed using the McCluskey algorithm, which I implemented with the help of the ‘logicmin’ library. For filling out the input cases (truth table), I used the ‘itertools’ library. Both of these libraries are available on GitHub.

This project was born out of a need I faced and is now available for others to use, especially since I couldn’t find an easy-to-use application online—most available options were web apps with limited input capacity and no accessible source code. The app is designed to be embedded in larger projects (without the GUI) so that you don’t have to manually code the cases, or you can use it as it is, with the GUI. This is also my first GitHub repository, and I believe it will be a useful resource for the community.
